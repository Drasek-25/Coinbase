This was my fourth lab at Redwood Code Academy. We were givin screenshots of the coinbase website from awhile back and asked to rebuild the .html and .css of the site from the images. This lab took me around 12 hours and I learned alot doing it. I stole all the proper stylings for the webpage from a cache of the coinbase site on wayback machine to match its look as close to perfect as possible.
